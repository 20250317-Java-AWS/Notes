I plan to spend about 3 hours per day on courseware, and will build up a review to conduct at ~3:00 PM   
~10:00 AM - ~1:00 PM - consuming courseware  
~3:00 PM - 4:00 PM - conducting group review  
 - Monday - late start - 2 hours on Cloud Foundations and Compute
 - Tuesday - 3 hours on Storage, Networking, and Databases
 - Wednesday - ~3 hours on Deployment, Migration, and AI
 - Thursday - ~3 hours finishing Deployment, Migration, and AI, and starting on Monitoring, Security, and Pricing
 - Friday ~3 hours finishing Monitoring, Security, and Pricing

Next week we will start reviewing with practice exams. Monday will start with Exam Preparation, we'll look at the question breakdowns together.
