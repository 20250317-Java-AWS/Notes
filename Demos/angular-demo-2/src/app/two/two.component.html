There once was a {{dataStore.species | lowercase | backwards}} named {{dataStore.name_1 | lowercase | backwards}} who loved to {{dataStore.verb_1 | lowercase | backwards}}. 
One day while {{dataStore.name_1 | lowercase | backwards}} was {{dataStore.verb_1 | lowercase | backwards}}ing {{dataStore.pronoun_1 | lowercase | backwards}} decided to {{dataStore.verb_2 | lowercase | backwards}}. 
{{dataStore.name_1}} was the first {{dataStore.species | lowercase | backwards}} to ever combine {{dataStore.verb_1 + "ing"  | lowercase | backwards}} and {{dataStore.verb_2 | lowercase | backwards}}ing!
That's the end of this story, it is a very {{dataStore.adjective_1 | lowercase | backwards}} story, honestly. I'll try harder next time.
