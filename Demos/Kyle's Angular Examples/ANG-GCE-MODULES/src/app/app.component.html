<h2>ANG-GCE-MODULES</h2>
<p>This is the root component of the Angular SPA. Check the developer tools in 
your browser and you can explore the HTML. You'll find the Pikachu, Charizard, 
and Mewtwo components nested within this component. Take a look at the imports array
in app.component.ts and you'll notice that those components are not included. 
Instead, we have included the PokemonModule, which transitively includes the 
three pokemon components.</p>
<p>Next, take a look at the NgModule decorator in pokemon.module.ts. There you'll 
find two arrays, imports and exports. Imports works exactly like we have seen before
making those dependencies available to that class. The exports array then also makes
them available anywhere this module is available.</p>
